# This uses some behind-the-scenes magic behavior: gets assigns the last line read to the
# global variable $_, the ~ operator does a regular expression match against $_, and
# print with no arguments prints $_. This kind of code is falling out of fashion in the
# Ruby community and may end up being removed from the language.

# The start and end of a range used in a boolean expression can themselves be expressions.
# These are evaluated each time the overall boolean expression is evaluated. For example, the
# following code uses the fact that the variable $. contains the current input line number to
# display line numbers 1 through 3 as well as those between a match of /eig/ and /nin/:

File.foreach("ordinal.txt") do |line|
  if (($. == 1) || line =~ /eig/) .. (($. == 3) || line =~ /nin/)

end

# Youâ€™ll come across a wrinkle when you use while and until as statement modifiers. If the
# statement they are modifying is a begin...end block, the code in the block will always
# execute at least one time, regardless of the value of the boolean expression

  print "Goodbye\n"          # => Goodbye
