# Ruby has two basic forms of assignment. The first assigns an object reference to a variable
# or constant. This form of assignment is hardwired into the language:

instrument = "piano"
MIDDLE_A = 440

# The second form of assignment involves having an object attribute or element reference on
# the left side. These forms are special, because they are implemented by calling methods in
# the lvalues, which means you can override them.

class ProjectList
  def initialize
    @projects = []
  end

  def projects=(list)
    @projects = list.map(&:upcase) # store list of names in uppercase

    # some_objects.each(&:foo)
    #
    # Is the same as
    #
    # some_objects.each { |obj| obj.foo }
    #
    # so list.map(&:upcase) is the same as
    #
    # list.map { |obj| obj.upcase }

# The value of the assignment is always the value of the parameter; the return value of the
# method is discarded. In the code that follows, result will be set to 2, even though the
# attribute setter actually returns 99.

  def val=(val)

# A common idiom is to use ||= to assign a value to a variable only if that variable isnâ€™t already set:
z ||= "default value"

# This is almost, but not quite, the same as
#
# z = z || "default value"
#
# It differs in that no assignment is made at all if the variable is already set. In pseudocode, this
# might be written as
#
# var = "default value" unless var
#
# or as
#
# var || var = "default value"

# not and ! return the opposite of their operand (false if the operand is true and true if the operand
# is false). And, yes, not and ! differ only in precedence.
